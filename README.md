# MKF 

*Previously known as PossumCoin*

Monkey Flip, also known as MKF, is a cryptocurrency designed in Typescript that gets difficult as time between two hashes are longer. The longer amount of time people wait, the longer it can get to hash. This plays into monkeys because as a monkey spins, they can get more speed. That time of how long the spin is done for is how much time it has been since the last coin was mined. So you better mine quick or else it will become too difficult to generate any more hashes. Currently, there's an instance of it being hosted at [crypto.monkeyflip.io](http://crypto.monkeyflip.io/).
